I am a PhD candidate in economics at Maastricht University and an ESR at the Research Centre for Education and the Labour Market (ROA). 

My primary research field is Labor Economics, with a special focus on the Economics of Education and Migration Economics and an interest in gender aspects of public policies.

My current [research](/publications/) focuses on the impact of geographical mobility, borders and immigration policies on labour markets and
educational opportunities. 

You can contact me at a.shirshikova@maastrichtuniversity.nl and find my [CV](http://alina-shirshikova.github.io/files/Academic_CV.pdf) here.

I am on the 2023-2024 Job Market
