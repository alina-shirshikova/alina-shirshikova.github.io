I am a PhD candidate in economics at Maastricht University and an ESR at the Research Centre for Education and the Labour Market (ROA). 

My long-standing interest lies in the intersection of labour, migration and education economics. 

My current [research](/publications/) focuses on the impact of borders, geographical mobility, migration and immigration policies on labour markets and
educational opportunities of individuals. 

You can contact me at a.shirshikova@maastrichtuniversity.nl and find my [CV](http://alina-shirshikova.github.io/files/Academic_CV.pdf) here.
